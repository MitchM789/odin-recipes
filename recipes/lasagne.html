    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease a 6-cup (1.5L) ovenproof dish.
        Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. 
        Add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 2-3 mins or until the onion softens. 
        Add the mince and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up lumps, 
        for 5 mins or until the mince changes colour.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste, herb paste and tomato to the mince mixture in the pan. 
            Cook, stirring, for 2 mins or until combined. Add the capsicum, carrot, zucchini and ¼ cup (60ml) water. 
            Cook, stirring, for 3-4 mins or until the mixture thickens slightly. Remove from heat. Stir through the beans. 
            Season. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Place the lasagne sheets in a large heatproof bowl. 
            Pour over enough boiling water to cover. Set aside for 1-2 mins to soften. 
            Refresh under cold water. Drain. Place the lasagne sheets on a clean work surface. 
            Arrange some of the mince mixture evenly over the centre of each lasagne sheet. 
            Fold over the edges of each lasagne sheet to enclose the filling. 
            Place the lasagne parcels, seam-side down, in the prepared dish.</li>
        <li>Combine pasta sauce and ricotta in a bowl. Spoon evenly over the top of each parcel. 
            Sprinkle with the cheddar. Bake for 35-40 mins or until the lasagne parcels are golden brown and heated through.</li>
    </ol>
